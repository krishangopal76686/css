1. What is the CSS Box Model?
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is a rectangular box made up of four parts:
Content → Padding → Border → Margin.
It defines how these parts affect the element’s size and spacing on a web page.

2. What are the components of the CSS Box Model?

Content: The actual content (text, image, etc.) inside the element.

Padding: Space between the content and the border.

Border: Surrounds the padding and content.

Margin: Space outside the border, separating the element from others.

3. What is the difference between margin and padding?

Margin: Space outside the element’s border — separates it from other elements.

Padding: Space inside the element’s border — pushes the content inward.

4. What does box-sizing: border-box do?
With box-sizing: border-box, the total width and height includes padding and border. This makes layout calculations easier because the declared width doesn't expand with padding/border.

5. What is the default value of box-sizing in CSS?
The default value is content-box, which means:
Total width = content width + padding + border
This can sometimes cause layout issues if not accounted for.

6. What is margin collapsing in CSS?
When vertical margins of two elements meet, the larger of the two margins is used — not the sum. This is known as margin collapsing and applies only to vertical margins.

7. How do padding and border affect the size of a box?
In content-box model, they increase the element's total size.
In border-box, they’re included in the total size.

8. How can you center a block element horizontally using the Box Model?
By applying margin: 0 auto; and setting a width on the element, it will be horizontally centered.

9. How can you inspect the Box Model in the browser?
Use Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect). Most browsers show a box diagram that breaks down content, padding, border, and margin visually.

10. Why is box-sizing: border-box often used in modern CSS?
It simplifies layout management by including padding and border in the element’s total width/height, making elements easier to size consistently, especially in responsive design.
